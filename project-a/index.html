                The chitsune is a fox like creature that belongs to the fox family. The ones with more tails signify
                older age. While they sometimes come in different colors, the most common is white with spots of red.
                Not much is known about the chitsune's family, as researchers have been unable to make contact long
                enough to document the interactions. It is speculated that the young ones typically stay with their
                parents until at least growing their second tail, as a chitsune with only one tail has never been
                spotted. Most chitsune spottings, they are typically alone and independant creatures, often seen without
                other chitsune. Traditionally, chitsune have loved to play tricks on humans, making them confused and shocked. 
                It is best known to never be too careful as even your closest friend could secretly be a chitsune.
                Although this is a popular story told amongst children to never be too trusting of outsiders.
